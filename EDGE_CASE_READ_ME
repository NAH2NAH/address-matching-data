There are two files that form a sample of 5,000 Edge Cases. One contains just a record id and the address as a 2 column csv file and should be used to test matching solutions (EDGE_CASES_5K.csv). The second is an excel file that provides the id to UPRN look-up and describes the classification of addresses in the test file (EDGE_CASES_EC5K.xlsx). It is required to evaluate the matches obtained on the test file.
